# world-weather-analysis
APIs, JSON traversal, and more.

## Summary
This challenge was designed to teach a basic to intermediate understanding of API calls, navigating JSON outputs via Python, and Dev Environment setup as it relates to installing external libraries and modules (GeoViews, hvplot, etc.) to be used in the analysis and presentation of data.

Contained within the Challenge File are 3 folders, all containing their own Deliverable. The "Weather Database" file (Deliverable 1) is the initial generation that "Vacation Search" (Deliverable 2) reads its .csv and associated DataFrames out of, which further refines search terms and the "Vacation Itinerary" (Deliverable 3) generates and displays a Waypoint Map of travel locations and a drive route for a vacation within Japan based on the information and (mostly temperature) preferences gathered via "Vacation Search".
